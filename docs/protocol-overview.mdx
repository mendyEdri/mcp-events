description: Core RPC methods and event lifecycle in MCPE.
---

MCPE uses JSON-RPC 2.0 and adds subscription-oriented methods on top of MCP concepts.

## Core method groups

- `mcpe/capabilities`: discover supported filters, channels, and limits.
- `mcpe/schema`: fetch operation schemas for agent/LLM reasoning.
- `subscriptions/create`: create a new event subscription.
- `subscriptions/update`: pause, resume, or change filtering.
- `subscriptions/remove`: unsubscribe.
- `notifications/event`: server-to-client event delivery.

## Typical flow

1. Client connects and initializes.
2. Client calls `mcpe/capabilities` and optionally `mcpe/schema`.
3. Client creates one or more subscriptions.
4. Server pushes matching events via `notifications/event`.
5. Client updates or removes subscriptions as needed.
