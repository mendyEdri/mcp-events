# MCP Events (MCPE)

MCP gives AI agents access to **tools** and **resources**, but agents currently lack a standardized way to **subscribe to and receive real-time events** from external systems. MCPE fills that gap.

## What is MCPE?

MCPE extends MCP with event subscriptions. Agents can subscribe to events, receive them in real-time, and react accordingly.
