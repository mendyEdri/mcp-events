title: Why MCPE?
description: The problem MCPE solves and how it compares to existing approaches.

## The Problem

MCP provides excellent primitives for agents to **act** on the world - tools, resources, and prompts. But agents currently lack a standardized mechanism to **react** to external events.

Consider these scenarios:
- An agent monitoring a GitHub repository for new issues
- An agent waiting for Slack messages in a specific channel
- An agent tracking deployment status updates
- An agent receiving email notifications

Today, agents must choose from suboptimal workarounds:

| Approach | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| **Polling** | Wasteful, slow, doesn't scale |
| **Webhooks** | Server-configured, not agent-controlled |
| **Custom integrations** | Non-standard, each service is different |
| **Long-lived connections** | Complex for serverless/ephemeral agents |

## The Solution

MCPE extends MCP with a standardized, **agent-controlled** event subscription mechanism. Agents decide what to subscribe to, how events should be delivered, and when to pause or stop.

## MCPE vs Webhooks

| Feature | Webhooks | MCPE |
|---------|----------|------|
| Agent controls subscription | No (server configured) | Yes |
| Pause/Resume | No | Yes |
| Filter by priority | No | Yes |
| Multiple delivery channels | No | Yes |
| LLM-readable schemas | No | Yes |
| Transport agnostic | No | Yes |
| Standardized protocol | No | Yes |
| Cron/scheduled batching | No | Yes |

## MCPE vs Polling

| Feature | Polling | MCPE |
|---------|---------|------|
| Latency | Depends on interval | Real-time |
| Resource usage | High (repeated requests) | Low (push-based) |
| Missed events | Possible between polls | No (queued delivery) |
| Filtering | Client-side after fetch | Server-side before delivery |
| Scalability | Poor | Good |

## Use Cases

### Autonomous Monitoring

An agent subscribes to GitHub issues and auto-triages them based on labels, priority, and content.

```typescript
await client.subscribe({
  filter: {
    sources: ["github"],
    eventTypes: ["github.issue.opened"],
    priority: ["high", "critical"],
  },
  delivery: { channels: ["realtime"] },
});
```

### Event-Driven Workflows

An agent reacts to Slack mentions, email arrivals, and calendar changes to coordinate team workflows.

```typescript
await client.subscribe({
  filter: {
    sources: ["slack", "gmail"],
    eventTypes: ["slack.message", "gmail.received"],
  },
  delivery: { channels: ["realtime"] },
});
```

### Daily Digests

An agent collects events throughout the day and delivers a summary on a cron schedule.

```typescript
await client.subscribe({
  filter: { sources: ["github"] },
  delivery: {
    channels: ["cron"],
    cronSchedule: {
      expression: "0 9 * * *",
      timezone: "America/New_York",
    },
  },
});
```

### Human-in-the-Loop

An agent receives approval events before proceeding with sensitive operations like deployments.

```typescript
await client.subscribe({
  filter: { eventTypes: ["approval.*"] },
  delivery: { channels: ["realtime"] },
  handler: {
    type: "agent",
    systemPrompt: "Process the approval and continue the deployment pipeline.",
    tools: ["deploy_to_production"],
  },
});
```

## Relationship to MCP

MCPE is designed to **complement MCP**, not replace it:

- **MCP Tools** = Agent performs actions (imperative)
- **MCPE Subscriptions** = Agent receives events (reactive)

MCPE uses standard MCP primitives - tools for subscription management, notifications for event delivery - so it works with any MCP-compatible transport and requires no protocol-level changes.
